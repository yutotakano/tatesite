## Project Structure

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                        |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| `yarn install`         | Installs dependencies                         |
| `yarn dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`   |
| `yarn build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`       |
| `yarn preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying  |
| `yarn astro ...`       | Run commands like `astro add`, `astro check`  |
